# ðŸ“‘ Prompt Templates for Popular AI Prompt Frameworks

A curated, production-ready library of **XML prompt templates** aligned with industry best practice for OpenAI, Antropic, Google, Meta, Alibaba and others (clear roles, data/instruction separation, structured outputs).  
This repository includes templates for **general-purpose tasks, reasoning/chain-of-thought, and specialized reflective/coaching scenarios**.

## Usage

1. Pick a framework template (e.g., templates/RISEN.md).
2. Replace bracketed placeholders: [role], [data], [output requirements].
(Optional) Instruct the model to return JSON for structured outputs.

## Best practices baked in

1. Clear role & audience
2. XML for inputs; 
3. JSON for outputs (optional)
4. Step-by-step reasoning hooks
5. Guardrails (donâ€™t invent facts, follow schema)
6. Iteration & reflection prompts

Example (RISEN)
<prompt>
  <role>You are a medical tutor.</role>
  <input>
    <data>[Insert patient case]</data>
  </input>
  <steps>
    - Identify key symptoms
    - Propose differentials
    - Justify each briefly
  </steps>
  <expectation>Return 3 differential diagnoses with reasoning.</expectation>
  <narrowing>Use only the provided data.</narrowing>
</prompt>
